Assignment: Java / Backend
===========

## About the assignment
This assignment consist of two tasks and a set of belonging questions. The first part is a pure development task while the second part is to deploy your code to Heroku.

## Intention
The assignment aims primarily to provide us with a freshly developed code base that you've authored. We'll look at your solution in combination with your answers to the questions but primarily it serves as a foundation for a discussion between us. We will discuss the solution with you in order to get a picture of how you work, how you've reasoned.
But the assignment also serves as an example of code that you might write, release and deploy as part of our team. This way we hope to convey a image of how you and we work in order for us to figure out if we might be a good match for each other. As much as this assignment is tailored to give us a view of who you are as programmer we also try to see it as a way for us to show you who we are and how we work.

## Execution
* You're allowed to:
    * Use, add and remove any libraries and frameworks you'd like as long as you manage them with Maven
    * Change the indention and/or reformat the code, as long as _all of the code_ is consistently formatted. All or nothing.
    * Take notes of and/or version the code during your work.
    * Question and criticize the assignment (too hard? too easy? too weird? not consistent?)
* You are not required to:
    * Document your solution other than answering the questions in this document
    * Save data persistently, it's sufficient if data is stored in memory while the solution is running
* You are not allowed to:
    * Resubmit your solution. We will check only the first one we get from you.

And remember, this is meant to be fun :)

### Preparations
* Install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), see also:
    * [installation](http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation)
    * [getting started](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com), see also:
    * [Try Git by Github](http://try.github.com/)
* If you're using Eclipse run `mvn eclipse:eclipse` in the root directory to create a project setup for [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
* Optional:
    * Install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

### Testing
* To run the unit tests: `mvn test`
* To start the server locally: `mvn exec:java`, it'll be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
* To package and run the packaged solution the solution:
    * `mvn clean package`
    * `java -jar target/java-backend-recruitment-1.jar server`

## The assignment

### Task 1
  * Implement the code that's missing so that the solution compiles and all tests pass
  * Resolve all `FIXME` comments
  * Write unit tests for your implementation of `PersonStorage` (whether you write the tests before or after the code is up to you)
  * **Make all (non-test) code, both _existing_ and new, follow these rules**:
    1. You're not allowed to have any getter/setter methods (that's to say you must not have any methods that expose/leak values from a class) - e.g. `Person` class currently contains `getEmail` which violates this rule.
    2. You're only allowed to have one level of indention per method
    3. Any given class must not have more than 2 instance variables - e.g. `Person` class currently has 3 instance variables which violates this rule.
    4. You're not allowed to use `else`, `else if` or `switch` (regular `if` statements are fine)
* Questions:
    1. What effect did applying the rules have on your code?
    2. Anything that became better?
    3. Anything that became worse?
    4. What's your impression and understanding of the frameworks and libraries we've used here?

### Task 2
* Register an Heroku account, setup a new application and deploy your solution:
    * It must run as a process of type `web`
    * It must use at least Java 11
* Questions:
    1. How do you feel about shipping and deploying code yourself?
    2. Who do you think should be responsible for code running in production?

## Expectations
We expect that you supply us with
* ...a zip file of your final solution
* ...the URL to your Heroku application
* ...a plain text document with your answers to the questions
    * Preferably placed in the zip file together with your code

## Final note
